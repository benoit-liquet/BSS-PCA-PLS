# BSS-PCA-PLS: Best Subset Selection for PCA and PLS models

Here we provide a comprehensible detailed vignette to run Best Subset Selection for PCA and PLS models

We illustrate the usage of our approach on two real dataset: _multidrug_ and _eQTL\_Hopx_.

This vignette reproduces details result of our application section **Case Studies** from our submitted article:

_Best Subset Selection for Principal Components Analysis and Partial Least Square models using Continuous Optimization_ B. Liquet, S. Moka and S. Muller. (2023).



## Getting Started

In this vignette we used the following R packages

```
library(mixOmics) # this package is available from Bioconductor
llibrary(rlist)
library(R.utils)
library(fields)
library(xtable)
```
